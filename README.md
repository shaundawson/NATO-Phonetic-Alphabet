# NATO Phonetic Alphabet Project
Convert a word or a phrase to NATO phonetic alphabet.

The NATO Phonetic Alphabet is the most widely used spelling alphabet. A spelling alphabet (aka radio alphabet, or telephone alphabet) is a set of words used to stand for the letters of an alphabet in oral communication. Each word in the spelling alphabet typically replaces the name of the letter with which it starts. It is used to spell out words when speaking to someone not able to see the speaker, or when the audio channel is not clear.
